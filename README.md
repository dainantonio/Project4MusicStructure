# Project4MusicStructure
Fourth project as part of Udacity's Android Basic Nanodegree
The goal of this project is to design and layout a music playing app that displays the list of available songs in a ListView, navigates to a details screen of the currently playing song, and uses explicit intents to navigate around the app.

Data about each song is stored in a custom class that is retrieved and displayed via a Loop and Adapter.

The required components for this project are:
2 to 6 Activities that are linked via explicit intents
A custom class storing information about each song. Each instance of the custom class must contain at least 2 states (e.g. Song Name, Artist Name). Images (e.g. Album Art) are not required but allowed.

A data structure, such as an ArrayList that would store Instances of the custom class. These instances should be retrieved and displayed in a ListView or GridView via an Adapter.
