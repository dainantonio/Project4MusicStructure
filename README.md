# Project4MusicStructure
Fourth project as part of Udacity's Android Basic Nanodegree
The goal of this project is to design and layout a music playing app that displays the list of available songs in a ListView, navigates to a details screen of the currently playing song, and uses explicit intents to navigate around the app.

Data about each song is stored in a custom class that is retrieved and displayed via a Loop and Adapter.
